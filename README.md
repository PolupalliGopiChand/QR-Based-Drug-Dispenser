# 💊 QR-Based Drug Dispenser

An intelligent, automated medication dispensing system that reads prescriptions via QR codes and delivers the right medicines with precision.

## 🚀 Overview

This project bridges healthcare and automation by replacing manual dispensing with a smart, camera-driven system. Doctors generate QR-coded prescriptions, which are scanned by a vending machine to dispense medicines accurately using stepper motors controlled by a Raspberry Pi.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, ULN2003 Driver, 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motors, Normal USB Camera
* **Software:** Python, OpenCV, pyzbar (QR decoding), RPi.GPIO
* **Prescription Format:** QR code containing medicine name and quantity

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Prescription Generation:** Doctor writes a prescription, auto-encoded into a QR code.
2. **QR Scanning:** Camera scans and decodes the QR using OpenCV + pyzbar.
3. **Processing:** Raspberry Pi identifies required medicines and quantities.
4. **Dispensing:** Stepper motors rotate specific compartments to dispense the medication.

## 🎯 Key Features

* Fully automated dispensing with zero human error
* Scalable for multi-medicine inventory
* Optimized for low-cost healthcare delivery
